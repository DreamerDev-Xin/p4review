= FEATURES HIGHLIGHT =

* Authenticates against SMTP and Perforce servers with TLS/SSL support.

* Unicode support - even for non-ACSII characters in non-unicode enabled server if you use a single encoding.

* Configurable email templates which an be hooked with [P4Web](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-clients?qt-perforce_graphical_tools=1#qt-perforce_graphical_tools) and [Swarm](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/swarm).

* Option to send summary email per user per invocation instead of one for each change.

* Put limits on the maximum message size and number of emails that get sent.

* Guards to prevent running multiple instances of the script by mistake.

* Built-in logging and extensive command-line options to facilitate debug and testing.

* Use P4Python when available for efficiency and fallback to the Perforce command line client gracefully.

* Option for users to opt-in (--opt-in-path) reviews from P4Review2 for smooth migration from other review notification systems.

= Usage =

# Create an sample configuration: <br>''python p4review2.py --sample-config > p4review2.conf''
# The file is in INI-like format. Edit the file to suit your needs. In particular, check settings for the following (check ''python p4review2.py -h'' for a list of all the current options):
## p4port
## p4user
## p4charset
## review_counter
## job_counter
## change_url
## job_url
## user_url
# Test the configuration with:<br>''python p4review2.py -c p4review2.conf -P''
# When ready, create a crontab (Linux/UNIX)/scheduled task (Windows) to run the above command without the -P option.
# Configuration can be overwritten on the command line via options. See ''python p4review2.py -h'' for the complete list.
