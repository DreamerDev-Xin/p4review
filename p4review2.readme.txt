Setting up P4Review2
====================

Here is how to setup P4Review2 in 3 simple steps:

1. Create an sample configuration:

   <code>python p4review2.py --sample-config > p4review2.conf</code>

   Edit the file to suit your needs. In particular, check settings
   for:

   * p4port
   * p4user
   * p4charset
   * review_counter
   * job_counter
   * change_url
   * job_url
   * user_url

   Simply set a setting to an empty string if it's not required.

2. Test the configuration with:

   <code>python p4review2.py -c p4review2.conf -P</code>

3. When ready, create a crontab (Linux/UNIX)/scheduled task (Windows)
   to run the above command without the -P option. When used with
   Windows's task scheduler you may need to create a batch file which
   calls the script with the correct command-line options.


Note that most configuration can be overridden on the command line via
options. Run "python2.7 p4review2.py -h" to get a complete list.
